# Extract-IVs: Extract IVs for the summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (MR)

## Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization ([SMR](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#Overview))
[SMR](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr/#Overview) (Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization) is a powerful method that allows the utilization of publicly available data for conducting Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. Instead of relying on individual-level data, SMR makes use of summary-level data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to identify potential causal relationships between a genetic trait (e.g., a genetic variant) and an outcome or phenotype.
